    <div class="markdown">
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 22, 2026</p>

      <p>By using Odonto.me, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.</p>

      <h4>1. About the Service</h4>
      <p>Odonto.me is a cloud-based platform that helps dental professionals manage patient records, schedule appointments, and process payments.</p>

      <h4>2. Your Account</h4>
      <p>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential and for all activity under your account. We store passwords using one-way hashing — no one at Odonto.me can see your password. If you suspect unauthorized access, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@odonto.me">hello@odonto.me</a>.</p>

      <h4>3. Subscription and Billing</h4>
      <p>After your free trial, a paid subscription is required. Subscriptions are billed through <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time from your practice settings. Fees are non-refundable except where required by law.</p>

      <h4>4. Patient Payment Collection</h4>
      <p>You may collect payments from patients through Stripe Connect. Odonto.me charges a 1% platform fee on each transaction. You are responsible for your own refund policies. Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank">terms</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> also apply.</p>

      <h4>5. AI Assistant</h4>
      <p>Odonto.me offers an optional AI assistant that lets third-party services (Claude by Anthropic, ChatGPT by OpenAI) manage your schedule through natural language. This feature is off by default and must be enabled by a practice administrator.</p>
      <p>When enabled, limited data (patient names, IDs, doctor names, appointment details) is shared with the connected AI service. Sensitive information (emails, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, allergies, insurance) is never shared. All AI actions are logged in your audit trail. You are responsible for reviewing changes made by the AI. You can revoke access at any time.</p>

      <h4>6. Health Data</h4>
      <p>You, as the dental practice, are the data controller for your patients' health information. You are responsible for obtaining patient consent and complying with applicable regulations (HIPAA, LGPD, GDPR, PIPEDA, or others in your jurisdiction). Odonto.me provides tools to manage this data securely but does not provide legal or compliance advice.</p>

      <h4>7. Your Data</h4>
      <p>You own the data you enter into Odonto.me. We do not claim ownership over your patient records, appointments, or notes. You grant us a limited license to store and process your data solely to provide the service. You can export certain data (such as balance records) in CSV format.</p>

      <h4>8. Acceptable Use</h4>
      <p>Do not use the service for unlawful purposes, attempt to access another practice's data, share credentials with unauthorized individuals, or use automated tools to disrupt the service.</p>

      <h4>9. Security</h4>
      <p>We protect your data with TLS encryption in transit, one-way password hashing, SHA-256 hashed API keys, firewalled infrastructure, role-based access controls, and audit logging. No system is perfectly secure — we recommend using strong passwords and signing out on shared devices.</p>

      <h4>10. Availability</h4>
      <p>We strive to keep Odonto.me available and reliable, but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access. The service may be temporarily unavailable for maintenance or updates.</p>

      <h4>11. Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p>Odonto.me is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our total liability shall not exceed what you paid us in the 12 months before the claim. We are not responsible for clinical decisions made based on data in the system.</p>

      <h4>12. Cancellation</h4>
      <p>You can close your account at any time from your settings. Your data will be retained for a reasonable period to allow reactivation or export, then permanently deleted. Contact <a href="mailto:hello@odonto.me">hello@odonto.me</a> if you need a data export before closing. We may also suspend accounts that violate these Terms or have unpaid subscriptions.</p>

      <h4>13. Changes</h4>
      <p>We may update these Terms and will notify you by email when we do. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

      <h4>14. Contact</h4>
      <p>Questions? Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@odonto.me">hello@odonto.me</a>.</p>

      <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, form the complete agreement between you and Odonto.me.</p>
