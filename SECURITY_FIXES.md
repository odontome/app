# Security Vulnerability Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities found and fixed in the Odontome Rails application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Mass Assignment Attack (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: `config.action_controller.permit_all_parameters = true` in application.rb
**Risk**: Allowed attackers to modify any model attribute through parameter manipulation
**Fix**: Removed permit_all_parameters and ensured all controllers use strong parameters
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized modification of sensitive data like user roles, practice_id, etc.

### 2. SQL Injection in Session Handling (HIGH)  
**Issue**: Direct session data usage in `User.find(session[:user]['id'])`
**Risk**: Possible SQL injection if session is compromised
**Fix**: Added proper validation and changed to use `find_by(id: ...)` with hash validation
**Impact**: Prevents SQL injection through session manipulation

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (HIGH)
**Issues Found**:
- Patient allergies field rendered without escaping
- Note content rendered without escaping
- Review comments using unsafe `html_safe`
- Email templates using unsafe `html_safe`
- Helper methods rendering user content without sanitization

**Fix**: Added `sanitize()` calls to strip HTML tags from all user-generated content
**Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks through patient data, notes, and reviews

### 4. Unsafe HTML Rendering (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Multiple uses of `html_safe` without proper sanitization
**Fix**: Removed unnecessary `html_safe` calls and added sanitization where needed
**Impact**: Reduces XSS attack surface

### 5. CSV Injection (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: User notes exported to CSV without sanitization
**Fix**: Strip dangerous characters (=+@-) from CSV exports
**Impact**: Prevents formula injection attacks in CSV exports

### 6. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Content Security Policy disabled
**Fix**: Enabled and configured CSP with secure defaults
**Impact**: Additional protection against XSS and other attacks

## Security Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Session Security
- Changed session storage to only store user ID instead of full user object
- Added proper session validation
- Improved remember token validation with format checking

### 2. Content Security Policy
- Enabled CSP with restrictive defaults
- Configured to prevent inline scripts and external resource loading
- Added frame-ancestors protection against clickjacking

### 3. Parameter Filtering
- Added filtering for sensitive tokens and credentials
- Prevents leakage of sensitive data in logs

### 4. Input Sanitization
- All user-generated content now properly sanitized
- HTML tags stripped from patient data, notes, reviews
- Safe rendering in all views and email templates

## Files Modified

### Configuration
- `config/application.rb` - Removed permit_all_parameters
- `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` - Enabled CSP
- `config/initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb` - Added token filtering
- `config/initializers/security_headers.rb` - Added security headers

### Controllers
- `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Fixed session handling and removed html_safe

### Models  
- `app/models/user.rb` - Enhanced remember token validation

### Views
- `app/views/patients/show.html.erb` - Sanitized allergies display
- `app/views/patients/_medical-history-card.html.erb` - Sanitized medical data
- `app/views/notes/_show.html.erb` - Sanitized note content
- `app/views/reviews/_show.html.erb` - Sanitized review comments
- `app/views/practice_mailer/*.html.erb` - Sanitized email content
- `app/views/practices/balance.csv.erb` - Fixed CSV injection
- `app/views/balances/index.csv.erb` - Fixed CSV injection

### Helpers
- `app/helpers/application_helper.rb` - Added sanitization to value_tag helper

### Tests
- `test/integration/security_test.rb` - Added comprehensive security tests

## Security Testing

Added integration tests to validate:
- XSS protection in patient views
- XSS protection in notes
- Secure session handling
- Strong parameter enforcement

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Perform periodic security reviews
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep gems updated for security patches
3. **Input Validation**: Continue validating all user input
4. **Security Headers**: Monitor and maintain CSP configuration
5. **Logging**: Monitor for security incidents in application logs

## Risk Assessment

**Before Fixes**: CRITICAL - Application was vulnerable to mass assignment, XSS, and SQL injection
**After Fixes**: LOW - All major vulnerabilities addressed with defense-in-depth approach

The application is now significantly more secure with proper input sanitization, strong parameter enforcement, and comprehensive security headers.
