    datebooks:
      <p>Datebooks are the backbone of every practice.</p> <p>Because you
      can already filter your datebooks by doctor, one common usage is to create one
      datebook per each of your practices.</p>
    doctors:
      <p>To better organize your staff, use different colors for each doctor.</p>
      <p>Please note that you can suspend doctors that are no longer in your staff
      to prevent them from appearing in Odonto.me, while still keeping all their data
      in your records.</p>
    patients:
      Easily the most important part of your practice. You can setup a patient
      fast by just filling out the few required fields, but it's strongly recommended
      you take the time to add as much info as possible.
    practice:
      <p>From here, you can update everything about your practice. Please
      take a moment to review all your options here.</p> <p>If from any reason you
      decide to leave us. You can %{close_url} at anytime.</p>
    cancel: <p>If you cancel your account, your data will be preserved for 14 days. After that, it will be removed from our servers.</p>
    treatments:
      Everything you do to your patients. These items are directly connected
      to the balance of your practice.
    users:
      <p>These are the people who have access to your Odonto.me.</p> <p>Since
      only you have access to these sections, it is recommended that you create users
      with less privilages to handle the day to day usage and leave your <strong>administrator</strong>
      account for management.</p>
